1)  How to read and implement Olapic API
    How to pull data from API

2)  Design (KISS) Simple, focus on API and less on technical

Decided to use jquery because it allows for normalization as its API allows me to make one call for all browsers.


a)(Design) Handing image Requests.  Fewer requests the better.  
Load carousel pictures as you need (i/o loading all images)
Load Pictures to right and left of images already loaded into carousel

b)As you scroll through (already loaded) carousel images, you do not want to request same images again.
Don't delete images that were loaded.  Build list as you go.

Functional design decisions:

What happens when you exhaust available images.  1) Stop and force user to scroll left or 2)loop back to first image.  How do you indicate this in UI?  1) Grey out arrow 2) Not sure

How do you indicate where in the list you are?

(optional)
If you open a lightbox, when do you want to download the file?  Only as you need (as this is the bigger/normal size image).

Requirements ask for 6 at a time.  Download 6 plus previous (could be last image if continuous) and next.

Which image to show in carousel (thumbnail)?

Overall look

3)  Technical
