1)  How to read and implement Olapic API
    How to pull data from API

2)  Design (KISS) Simple, focus on API and less on technical

Decided to use jquery because it allows for normalization as its API allows me to make one call for all browsers.


a)(Design) Handing image Requests.  Fewer requests the better.  
Load carousel pictures as you need (i/o loading all images)
Load Pictures to right and left of images already loaded into carousel

b)As you scroll through (already loaded) carousel images, you do not want to request same images again.
Don't delete images that were loaded.  Build list as you go.

3)  Technical
